|1 |[Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)| Vladimir Karpukhin, et.al.| Consider three differenttypes of negatives (1) Random: any random passage from the corpus;  (2) BM25: top passages returned by BM25 which donâ€™t contain the answer but match most question tokens; (3) Gold: positive passages paired with other questions which appear in the training set.||
